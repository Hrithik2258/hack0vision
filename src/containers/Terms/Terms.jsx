<p>➡️ All design elements, code, hardware builds, etc. for your project must be created
during the event. Third party tools and frameworks are allowed as well as your
normal tooling (Gulp, Yeoman, Composer, NPM, Bower, etc.). While you may
not begin coding in advance, you can plan and discuss with your team in
advance. Written documents and design sketches are allowed.  
<br /> <br />
➡️ You may also incorporate pre-existing material that is freely available to the
public into your project, such as public domain images, Creative Commons
music, open-source libraries, existing APIs and platforms, and the like.
<br /><br />
➡️ Teams will be given up to three minutes to present their finished project to a
panel of judges in the final round
<br /> <br />
➡️ Changes to team members are not permitted after registration.
<br /><br />
➡️ No development may start before the actual date and time of the event. Any
teams that violate this rule will be automatically disqualified.
<br /><br />
➡️ Any software development tools, game engine, IDE, and/or programming
language can be used for the event. If a team member uses a purchased tool
licensed to him or her and the license is not transferable to other members the
member’s team must choose one available to all developer teams.
<br /><br />
➡️ All teams should have a team name, and be registered 
<br /><br />
➡️ All teams should provide list of the following;<br /><br />
1. The development tools used to build the project<br /><br />
2. SDKs used in the project, include sponsors WayRay, ESRI, AutoDesk and
PTC/Vuforia<br /><br />
3. APIs used in the project<br /><br />
4. Any assets used in the project<br /><br />
5. Any libraries used in the project<br /><br />
6. Any components not created at the hackathon<br /><br />
7. A link to the team Github repository
<br /><br /><br /><br />
➡️ Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience
(or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of
hackathon participants in any form.<br /><br />
➡️ Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks
created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.<br /><br />

➡️ All team members should be present at the event. Leaving the venue for some
time to hack elsewhere is fine.<br /><br />
➡️ Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers,
sponsors, and others.<br /><br />
➡️ Teams can use an idea they had before the event.<br /><br />
➡️ Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be
“innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be
allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack.<br /><br />
➡️ Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to
debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up.<br /><br />
➡️ The responsibility of the components and the materials required for developing
the prototype during the Hackathon lies solely on the participating teams.<br /><br />
➡️ An Eligible Individual may join only one Team. If a Team is entering the
Hackathon, they must appoint and authorize one individual (the “Team Leader”)
to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf. The Team Leader and
each Team member who participates in the Challenge must meet the eligibility
requirements above. By entering a Submission on the Site on behalf of a Team
you represent and warrant that you are the Representative authorized to act on
behalf of your Team.<br /><br />
➡️ You will be bound by and comply with these Official Rules and the decisions of
the Administrator, and/or the Hackathon Judges which are binding and final in
all matters relating to the Hackathon.<br /><br />
➡️ The entire idea need not be fully implemented however, the submission should
be functional so that it can be reviewed by the judges.<br /><br />
➡️ All the candidates should abide by and follow proper dressing codes (no shorts
and pyjamas allowed).<br /><br />
